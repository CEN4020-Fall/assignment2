- Inheritance: refers to a child class inheriting attributes/methods from a parent class
- Polymorphism: refers to the ability in OOP to use the same interface but come out with different results due to underlying structure
- Encapsulation: refers to encapsulating data and the means to operate on that data together such as in a class.

The main difference is that in the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow, the changes are first merged through the lieutenants before everything is brought together by the dictator
In the Integration Manager workflow, the manager integrates everything himself (manager = dictator).

A team of 100 developers would benefit from the D and L workflow compared to the centralized workflow in that their personal responsibility for ensuring there are no conflicts is
highly reduced. The scale for resolving conflicts with 100 different devs surely becomes very big and confusing. The D and L workflow separates this problem into subproblems that are 
easier with the lieutenants and then fully resolve it at the dictator step.
