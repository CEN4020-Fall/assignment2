b)

There have been 9 commits that have been done to the repository and I used
the [git rev-list --all --count] command to get this information.

c)

The .gitignore file was last modified on Wednesday September 25th and I used
the [git log .gitignore] command to get this information.

d)

Branches are used in a Git repository to retain the history of the original 
line of development while also allowing mutliple people to work on a single
code work at the same time.

e)

Git log is used as a running record of commits while git status displays 
the state of the working direcotry and lets you see which changes have
been made.

f)

I would use the command [git log -p Vehicle.h] to see when this specific 
files was committed.

g)

I would use the command [git log --all --grep='file'] to see which commits
have commit messages with the word "file".

h)

In object oriented programming, inheritance is used to allow new objects to
take on properties of existing objects. Polymorphism is the concept of 
objects of different types being accessed through the same interface. 
Encapsulation is the briging together of data and methods that work 
together in one unit like a class.

i)

The main difference between the dictator and lieutenants workflow 
and the integration manager workflow is that dictator and lieutenants only
has one central repository that everyone pulls from and the dictator pushes 
to while integration manager has two repositories per developer and each 
developer can push or pull.

j)

How would a team of 100 developers benefit from following the "dicator and 
lieutenants" workflow instead of the "centralized" workflow?
A team of 100 developers could benefit from using the dictator and lieutenants
workflow instead of the centralized workflow because instead of every developer
having to resolve conflicts before pushing only the dictator will control this
and there will be less issues arising or differences between code.


5.
The Driving simulator prototype is using polymorphism and I can tell this because
function overloading can occur and the classes all inherit from one specific class.
