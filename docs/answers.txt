2.  How many commits have been done to the repository (not only by you, but by anyone) so far? Write the git command you used to get this information (4 points)
    8 commits have been done,

    $ git log

3.  When was the README.md  file modified last? Write the git command you used to get this information (4 points)

         Updated information files
        Updated the repository owner information in the README.md

4.  Mention two reasons why branches are used in a Git repository (4 points)
    Branches are useful to allow work to be done on parts of a program without possibly making a change that can damage other parts.

5.  What is the difference between git log and git status? (4 points)
    git log is to see the commit history of a project while git status lets you see the status of the working directory and the staging area.

6.  What command would you use to see the commits where “Vehicle.h” was one of the committed files? (4 points)
    git log -- Vehicle.h
7.  What command would you use to see the commits whose commit message contains the word “file”? (4 points)
    git log -all grep='file'
8.In the context of object-oriented programming (I) What is inheritance? (II) What is polymorphism? (III) What is encapsulation? (6 points)
    Inheritance is the property of passing on certain characteristics and functions/methods of a parent class to other
    "subclasses" or "child" classes. It allows for the reuse the code from the parent class.

    Polymorphism is the ability to redefine methods or functions to allow derived classes to use said functions,but with
    slight differences in implementation.

    Encapsulation refers to keeping the inner workings of a class private and thus hidden from the user. The user only
    needs to know how to use the class, not how its implemented.

9.  What is the main difference between the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow and the “Integration manager” workflow? (5 points)
    In the dictator and lieutenants workflow developers push their changes to a lieutenants, and they then send ti to the
     dictator, and they then push to the main branch. In an integration manager workflow developers have a public and
     private repository which the integration manager pulls from and then pushes to the main repository.

10. How would a team of 100 developers benefit from following the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow instead of the “Centralized” workflow? (5 points)
    Clearly, it would make more sense to have developers send their changes to someone  else (Lieutenants) to work out the merging rather than having developers
    constantly having to constantly pull changes in order to push their own. It's possible there could be a long delay if a bunch of developers start pushing
    at the same time.
