e.a)	On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

e.b)	git shortlog
17

e.c)	git log --follow .gitignore

e.d)	1)allowing people to review changes
	2)allow's bugs to be fixed when software is live and the fix can be implemented during the next update when the branch is merged with the master.

e.e)	Git status shows the state of the working directory and what changes have been staged and not tracked. Git Log allows you to view information about previous commits that have occurred in the project.

e.f)	git log -p Vehicle.h

e.g)	git log --all --grep='file'

e.h) 	Inheritance is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from a family of classes that share attributes. 
	Polymorphism is a programming language's ability to process objects depending on data type.
	Encapsulation is the bundling of data and functions that work on the data in one class.

e.i) Integration workflows users have public and private 
branches to work from.

e.j) It allows for only one person to push to the master 
instead of multiple small developers pushing to the master and 
causing issues.



5) The Driving simulator prototype uses polymorphism since it 
sets the brand and model of a vehicle regardless of its a 
powered vehicle or an unpowerd vehicle. The Driving simulator 
prototype uses encapsulation since all the different aspects 
of the vehicle are in the private data section.
