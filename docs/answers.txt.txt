Makes sure your code changes are verified before delivering them to other developers
-Support quality assurance/code quality/integration/testing processes
-Better support for developers working in parallel

e)
The git log command displays committed snapshots. It lets you list the project history, filter it, and search for specific changes. 
While git status lets you inspect the working directory and the staging area, git log only operates on the committed history.

f)
git log --follow -- vehicle.h


g)

git log --grep=file

h)

Inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class while
retaining similar implementation.

Polymorphism is a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on 
their data type or class. More specifically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes

Encapsulation describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit

i) Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow: ******Distributed development and integration.******8
One central/blessed repository:Everyone makes pull from this repository. Only the dictator can push to it.
•Dictator repository: Merges changes in the lieutenant repositories and solves any arising conflicts.
•Lieutenant repositories: Merges changes for some (not all) developers and solves conflicts. A developer
pushes changes to the assigned lieutenant repository.

Integration Manager WorkflowFrom: Each developer makes push to his/her own public repository, 
and pull from the blessed/central repository.
Two repositories per developer(Public/private) 
Integration conflict resolution are done by the integration manager.
(Centralized integration)Each developer makes pull and push to his/her own public repository.

j)

A team of developers would benefit from the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow since they can all commit their
changes to the same repository and solve any arising conflicts, the final product is clean since only the
dictator can push to it

Object Oriented Question)

It uses both encapsulation and polymorphism.

The simulater is using encapsulation by having classes that encompass functions and by separating the member data and functions into different levels of protection. On the other hand, virtual functions are being used in the vehicle and powered vehicle classes so it has polymorphism. the common function name serves the purpose of polymorphism
